## GoodWeather

# People who want to see a visual representation of the weather forecast and trends based on the type of weather they enjoy will love this product.

GoodWeather will show people local and national weather forecasts represented as colors that describe how favorable the weather conditions are based on criteria the user can pick. Users will be able to see current weather conditions either nationally or locally as well as trends in the short term forecast. The color scheme will allow users to decide what features of the weather are important to them while ignoring irrelevant details.

Weather forecasts are useful to people, but may either exclude information users are interested in or provide details that they do not care about and. GoodWeather will allow users to easily choose which criteria they care about and combine these into an overall forecast represented by a color scheme. “GoodWeather is both more informative and easier to use than other weather forecasting apps”, said a spokesperson from the company.

Getting started will be very simple, with users choosing the criteria they want from a list of popular options, and the location they want to know about. A customer said, “I love using  this app because it is simple and shows me exactly what I need to know”. So try it today at *theurl* and change the way you see weather.
